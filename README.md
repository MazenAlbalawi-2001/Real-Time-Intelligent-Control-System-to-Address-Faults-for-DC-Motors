Abstract

This project focuses on enhancing the modeling of Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motors
through the application of advanced machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to
develop accurate predictive models for key motor parameters, which are essential for efficient
motor control and performance optimization.
Initially, we developed models to predict motor velocity based on voltage inputs. This involved
training machine learning algorithms on a dataset comprising various voltage inputs and their
corresponding motor velocities. Additionally, we created models to estimate rotor angular
velocity from pulse width modulation (PWM) signals. These models were trained using data that
mapped PWM signals to the resulting angular velocities of the rotor.
The predictive models for motor velocity and rotor angular velocity were then integrated to
estimate rotor temperature. Rotor temperature is a critical parameter that significantly affects
motor efficiency and longevity, yet it is challenging to measure directly due to the nonlinear
behavior of PMDC motors. By combining the outputs of the velocity and angular velocity
models, we developed a comprehensive approach to estimate rotor temperature accurately.
Our approach aims to improve motor control and efficiency in practical applications by
providing more accurate predictions of these key parameters. This enhanced modeling can lead
to better performance, reduced energy consumption, and extended lifespan of PMDC motors.
Future work will focus on applying these models to actively control rotor temperature, further
improving motor performance and longevity. This project demonstrates the potential of machine
learning to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, offering significant advancements in
the field of motor control and efficiency.
